Installation Guide:
- Place the Phase3 folder inside of htdocs
- Turn on XAMPP (Apache/MySQL)
- Navigate to the PHPMyAdmin page
- Select the DB2 Database
- Click on the "Import" button and browse to the ./Sql/CreateTables.sql file. Click "GO".
- Open up build.gradle inside of Phase3/Java/db2
- Using a "Pixel 2 API 29" Emulator, start the application

*Note: The application should still work on other emulators, but was tested on Pixel 2, so it is optimized for that device
